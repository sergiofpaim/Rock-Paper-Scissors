# **Rock-Paper-Scissors**
Rock Paper Scissors game made with C# and Windows Forms.

Pre-College study #1

# About this study exercise
This game was my first coding exercise, it was created to reproduce simplified coding logic using a linked list.
## Previous stage
I had just entered the [Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU)](https://facom.ufu.br/en) to study computer science 🙌💪

I wanted to warm me up before start taking classes.
### Challenge 
My challenge was to create a rock, paper and scissors game in the most simplified way possible. All the research I did pointed me to unstructured and hardcoded examples that weren't as efficient as I wanted my code to be.
### Concepts Learned.
I learned to write more simplified codes, while maintaining syntax and readability in the data structure.
### Next Stage
My next step is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game, to better understand how to use arrays in C#.
